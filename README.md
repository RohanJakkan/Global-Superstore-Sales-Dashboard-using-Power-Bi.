# Global-Superstore-Sales-Dashboard-using-Power-Bi.
The Global Superstore Dashboard is a dynamic dashboard design that highlights sales and profits for a global store with multiple sites. Details are given by country, region, and city, as well as by product category and sub-category.  This level of detail means that users can determine the cities where, for example, mobile phone cases are making the highest profits and those cities where they do not sell as well.  Click on any of the countries or regions to update the sales vs profits sub-category, and vice versa, giving full control of the data. This dynamic updating also means that you can get rid of redundant data. If UK stores do not sell cell phone cases, data for these products wonâ€™t be displayed when the user clicks on the UK country selector.  The top right of the dashboard offers trend data so that users can view sales and profit figures over a five-year period. Need to know whether a product is selling well simply because of seasonality, or if a poor month is indicative of an ongoing product slump? Trend data can point you in the right direction.  This is a well-organized and dynamic dashboard that looks good and makes it easy to ignore irrelevant information and data.
